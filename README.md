Here is an English-Hindi implementation of three seminal papers in Neural Machine Translation:

1. Effective Approaches to Attention-based Neural Machine Translation ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.04025))
2. Sequence to Sequence Learning with Neural Networks ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.3215))
3. Neural Machine Translation by Jointly Learning to Align and Translate ([link](https://arxiv.org/abs/1409.0473))
